## Reflection and Self Assessment

Discuss the issues you encountered during development and testing. What
problems did you have? What did you have to research and learn on your
own? What kinds of errors did you get? How did you fix them?

What parts of the assignment did you find challenging? Is there anything that
finally "clicked" for you in the process of working on this assignment? How well
did the development and testing process go for you?

What I found challenging about this assignment was making the classes and finding the closest driver to the rider.
Nothing really clicked during the assignment it was just a lot of work to accomplish.
The development and testing process went well for the most part besides testing certain cases.
