## Reflection and Self Assessment

Discuss the issues you encountered during development and testing. What
problems did you have? What did you have to research and learn on your
own? What kinds of errors did you get? How did you fix them?

What parts of the assignment did you find challenging? Is there anything that
finally "clicked" for you in the process of working on this assignment? How well
did the development and testing process go for you?

The hardest part of the assignment for me was to figure out how I was going to orginize all the parsed data into a priority queue. Once I figured that out completing the actual code for this assignment wasn't too bad. Some errors I got involved with making a compartor for the priority queues not working but after that it worked well.
