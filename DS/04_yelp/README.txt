## Reflection and Self Assessment

Discuss the issues you encountered during development and testing. What
problems did you have? What did you have to research and learn on your
own? What kinds of errors did you get? How did you fix them?

What parts of the assignment did you find challenging? Is there anything that
finally "clicked" for you in the process of working on this assignment? How well
did the development and testing process go for you?

A few problems I had was understand the code that was provided to me since it sometimes didn't work as I intended it too. Other than that it wasn't too bad just had to make the class and learn how to work with list.
