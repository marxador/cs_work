## Reflection and Self Assessment

Discuss the issues you encountered during development and testing. What
problems did you have? What did you have to research and learn on your
own? What kinds of errors did you get? How did you fix them?

What parts of the assignment did you find challenging? Is there anything that
finally "clicked" for you in the process of working on this assignment? How well
did the development and testing process go for you?

Some problems I came across while developing was mostly just learning what you can and can not do in this language compared to other languages I have done in the past(Python, Java, and C#). Like with file writing, I forgot there was completely different object if you want to write and it took me 5-10 minutes of debugging to realize that. Another major problem I came across was just learning how to use vectors since I've never used them before. When I tried to use erase(position) it threw an error at me and I didn't know you need the actual pointer to use erase(). Therefore I had to use c++ tutorial websites that showed examples to see why what I was doing was wrong. Submitty also helped a lot with showing me basic stuff that seemed obvious but didn't know for sure, like if statements and ect. The hardest part of this assingment was getting used to using the std library. After a bit I got used to writing it before strings and vectors. I saw you could include it into the global namespace. I didn't want to tho since it might cause more bugs and seemed better to learn it this way first before I did anything too fancy. Testign and developing the code went great for the most part. There was no error that caused a major roadblock or made me want to restart.
