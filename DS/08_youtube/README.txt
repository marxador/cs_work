MISC. COMMENTS TO GRADER:
(optional, please be concise!)


## Reflection and Self Assessment

Discuss the issues you encountered during development and testing. What
problems did you have? What did you have to research and learn on your
own? What kinds of errors did you get? How did you fix them?

What parts of the assignment did you find challenging? Is there anything that
finally "clicked" for you in the process of working on this assignment? How well
did the development and testing process go for you?

The hardest part about this assignment was figuring out how to make my tree so when comments were placed they would be in the right order and indentation.
Once that was figured out there were some other minor difficulties such as accidently skipping the first line in the inputfile2, 
figuring out how to add replies, and making sure my search function actual worked properly. To fix error mostly I outputted what values were and could then 
realize that something was wrong and needed to be fixed.
