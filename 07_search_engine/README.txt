## Reflection and Self Assessment

Discuss the issues you encountered during development and testing. What
problems did you have? What did you have to research and learn on your
own? What kinds of errors did you get? How did you fix them?

What parts of the assignment did you find challenging? Is there anything that
finally "clicked" for you in the process of working on this assignment? How well
did the development and testing process go for you?

Figuring out how to parse html data was annoying, sorting took like 10 hours to figure out, it just took a lot of testing and debugging to figure it out. The professors website was very helpful in debugging the page score.
